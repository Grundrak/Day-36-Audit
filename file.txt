Action: Rename your URLs to use plural nouns when referring to collections of resources (e.g., /products instead of /product).
Why: Using names that everyone understands makes your API easier to use and maintain.

Give the Right Feedback with HTTP Response Codes:
Action: Make sure your API returns the right HTTP response codes for different situations.

Why: Correct response codes help both you and others understand what's happening with each request (e.g., 201 Created when something new is made, 404 Not Found when something isn't there).
Share Useful Information in Response Bodies:
Action: When something new is created or updated, share helpful info in the response, like where it can be found.
Why: It's like getting a receipt after a purchase; you want to know what you just did and where to find it.

Keep Your URLs Consistent:
Action: Make sure your URLs consistently show what's a resource and what's an action.
Why: Consistency is like following a map with clear directions; it's easier to understand and follow.

Help Users Navigate Through Long Lists with Pagination:
Action: Add support for pagination, so users can see small chunks of data at a time.
Why: Imagine reading an encyclopedia; it's easier to handle one page at a time than the whole book.

Let Users Update or Delete Multiple Items at Once:
Action: Allow users to update or delete multiple items in one go with PUT and DELETE methods.
Why: It's like allowing people to check out with a shopping cart instead of one item at a time.

Be Careful with Data Input and Handle Errors Gracefully:
Action: Check the data users send to your API and handle any mistakes gracefully.
Why: Just like a cashier who double-checks your order to avoid any mix-ups, your API should ensure data accuracy and give clear explanations if something goes wrong.

Use Clear and Consistent Names for Query Parameters:
Action: Keep query parameter names simple and consistent across your API.
Why: It's like using common language when asking for directions; it helps everyone understand what you need.

Create a User-Friendly Manual (Documentation):
Action: Write up a clear guide (documentation) for your API, explaining what it does, how to use it, and what to expect.
Why: Think of it as providing a user manual for a gadget; it helps people understand and use your API correctly.

Test Thoroughly to Ensure Everything Works as Expected:
Action: Test your API thoroughly to catch and fix any issues or bugs.
Why: It's like making sure your car runs smoothly before taking a long road trip; you want everything to work as expected.
